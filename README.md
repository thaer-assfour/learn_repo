1. Connect `LoginUIScreen` into `main.dart`
2. Design the Login Page, Without defining http client here

3. Implement login to consume `login` function from `login_server` class
4. inside `login service` Implement `post` from `fake_server` to "send" the login request.
5. If you get a non null result the login success, else it has failed.
6. react to changes in the UI, navigate to home when login success. Show an error if it failed.

That's all for now, good luck :slightly_smiling_face:
